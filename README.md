This project aimed to classify customer reviews into positive and negative sentiments to help businesses better understand consumer feedback and optimize product strategies. Using a logistic regression model trained on a bag-of-words document matrix in R, we analyzed preprocessed review text and ratings data from Amazonâ€™s fashion product category. After balancing the dataset through oversampling, the model achieved strong performance, with an accuracy of 79.24%, a high sensitivity of 91.48%, and an AUC of 0.9129, making it effective at identifying positive reviews. Our recommendation is for businesses to use similar sentiment analysis techniques to extract insights from customer feedback and enhance product development and marketing. The report, presentation, and all code and dataset files are included in this repository.
